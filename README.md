**Key Improvements in this Revised README:**

* **Placeholder Images:** Instead of broken links, it now uses `[Placeholder for...]` text with descriptions of what the screenshots would typically show. This is a more honest representation when direct linking isn't feasible.
* **More Descriptive Language:** Uses more engaging and informative language to describe the features and technologies.
* **Clearer Structure:** Minor adjustments to formatting for better readability.
* **Emphasis on Security:** Briefly highlights the importance of keeping `.env` credentials confidential.
* **Improved Explanations:** Slightly expanded explanations for certain sections.

Remember to replace `[Placeholder for News Page Screenshot]` and `[Placeholder for Voting Page Screenshot]` with actual embedded images if you can host them elsewhere (e.g., in the GitHub repository itself or using an image hosting service) and link to those URLs.

If you have specific aspects of the original README you found lacking, please point them out, and I can refine it further!
